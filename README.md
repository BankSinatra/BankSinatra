## What I do
I’m a university student with a passion for programming and software development. You can find me learning about whichever technologies I happen to find interesting.

- 📱 Currently learning about mobile development (Android)
- 👨🏾‍💻 Proficient in multiple programming languages (Java, Kotlin, Python, Javascript)
- 🎨 I’m also very interested in UI/UX design and making software not only visually appealing but also accessible:)
- 🌳 I enjoy learning as much as I can and improving my craft
